      <td>Crabs are decapod crustaceans, either the Brachyura (the "true crabs") or various 
        groups within the closely related Anomura (hermit crabs and allies), characterised by having a
         heavily armoured shell, their tail segments concealed under the body, the ability to run sideways,
          and the habit of hiding in rocky crevices. They do not form a single natural group or clade, but have 
          convergently evolved multiple times from the ancestral decapod body plan through carcinisation, the 
          process of creating this set of characteristics. As a group, they are thus polyphyletic, meaning they 
          have multiple evolutionary origins.</td>

      <td>A squid (pl. squid) is a mollusc with an elongated soft body, large eyes, eight arms, and two tentacles in the orders Myopsida, Oegopsida, and Bathyteuthida (though many other molluscs within the broader Neocoleoidea are also called squid despite not strictly fitting these criteria). Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head, bilateral symmetry, and a mantle. They are mainly soft-bodied, like octopuses, but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like gladius or pen, made of chitin.</td>

      <td>Clam is a common name for several species of bivalve mollusc. The word is often applied only to those that are deemed edible and live as infauna, spending most of their lives halfway buried in the sand of the sea floor or riverbeds. Clams have two shells of equal size connected by two adductor muscles and have a powerful burrowing foot.[1] They live in both freshwater and marine environments; in salt water they prefer to burrow down into the mud and the turbidity of the water required varies with species and location; the greatest diversity of these is in North America</td>
